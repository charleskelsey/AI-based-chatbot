        "text": "By Julie DesGroseilliers, Registered Dietitian When it comes to losing weight, there’s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits…for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you’ll improve your health and daily vitality. Ideas to lighten up your meals Replace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It’s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant. On pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables. Substitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or “spiralize” vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version. Replace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly. Add edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes. Nutritious snacks Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1] make them a priority at snack-time.

Containing twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup. Instead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo. Low in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto. Snack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips! Need a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt. No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate.

These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information.\nWe may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, correct addresses and conduct identity verification and other fraud-detection activities. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.\nPlease note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites.\nOther general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research)"

How do we protect your personal information?\nWe use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as our website and social community features or other social areas.\nWe store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis.

For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases.\nPrior authentication for account access\nWe require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.\nMeasures we expect you to take\nIt is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer.

What information do we collect?\nDepending on how you interact with us (online, offline, over the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate), as described in this section.\nPersonal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information that can be used to personally identify you, whether alone or in combination with other available information, whereas aggregate information does not allow for such identification.\nIn some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information with account login and/or demographic information) and store them together in our records. In cases, where personal and aggregate information are combined, such information will always be considered as personal information. We strive to limit the amount of personal information we collect and store to that which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally store your personal information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your personal information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes."

Noodles are economical to produce and could be dried and kept for long periods of time. The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores.
